    <h3> How It started ?</h3>> 

    <h2 style="color:lightgoldenrodyellow; font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif;;">
        In 2013, three radical Black organizers  — Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi <br> — created a Black-centered political will and movement building project called #BlackLivesMatter . <br> It was in response to the acquittal of Trayvon Martin’s murderer, George Zimmerman.
<br>
<br>
        <h3> What Is It ?  ?</h3>> 
    </h2>
    <h2 style="color:lightgoldenrodyellow; font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif;;"> Black Lives Matter (BLM) <br> is an organized movement advocating for non-violent civil disobedience <br> in protest against incidents of police brutality against African-American people <br>.[2] An organization known simply as Black Lives Matter <br> exists as a decentralized network with over 30 chapters <br> in the United States and sister organizations worldwide <br> while a larger Black Lives Matter movement exists consisting  <br>of various separate like-minded organizations such as Dream Defenders and Assata's Daughters <br>. The broader movement and its related organizations typically advocate against police violence <br> towards black people <br>, as well as for various other policy changes considered to be related to black liberation.[7] </h2>

<h3> Target </h3>
<h2 style="color:lightgoldenrodyellow; font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif;;"> "We are working for a world where Black lives are no longer systematically targeted for demise. <br>

    We affirm our humanity <br>, our contributions to this society, and our resilience in the face of deadly oppression.<br> The call for Black lives to matter is a rallying cry for ALL Black lives striving for liberation."
